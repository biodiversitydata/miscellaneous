**Chelsa**

> **C**limatologies at **h**igh resolution for the **e**arth’s **l**and **s**urface **a**reas is a very high resolution (30 arc sec, ~1km) global downscaled climate data set 

Technical specifications [PDF](https://chelsa-climate.org/wp-admin/download-page/CHELSA_tech_specification_V2.pdf) : read it before you download anything !

Meta data or data paper...?


## Land cover

**Corine Land Cover**

[CORINE Land Cover (CLC)](https://land.copernicus.eu/en/products/corine-land-cover) is a pan-European land cover and land use inventory with 44 thematic classes, ranging from broad forested areas to individual vineyards

Updated every six years (most recent in 2018).

<br>

**Copernicus**

>  Earth observation component of the **European Union’s Space programme**, looking at our planet and its environment to benefit all European citizens. It offers information services that draw from satellite Earth Observation and in-situ (non-space) data.

At the heart of Copernicus is a constellation of satellites – the Sentinels – that make a huge number of daily observations of the Earth ecosystem. 

Each satellite has its specificities and you should read about them before anything else.

Download data through many different portals: Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Portal, Copernicus Marine Monitoring Service (CMEMS) Portal, [Copernicus Land Monitoring Service](https://land.copernicus.eu/en) where Corine is just one of them...

<br>

**WorldCover**

> WorldCover provides the first global land cover products for 2020 and 2021 at 10m resolution, developed and validated in near-real time based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data.

Data access protocol [here](https://esa-worldcover.org/en/data-access).




## Soil data

**HWSD**

> Harmonized World Soil Database is a 30 arc-second raster database with over 15 000 different soil mapping units that combines existing regional and national updates of soil information worldwide.

Data access description [here](https://www.fao.org/soils-portal/data-hub/soil-maps-and-databases/harmonized-world-soil-database-v12/en/).

<br><br>

**SoilTemp**

> Global database of microclimate time series (soil and near-surface temperatures, soil moisture, …) and associated species data for use in ecology and beyond.

100.000 time series from more than 100 countries across the globe, submitted by more than a thousand data contributors. **The database is still under development and data is not yet open access.**

Metadata of the first part of our database can however already be freely explored [here](https://www.soiltempproject.com/the-soiltemp-database).


## Ecoregions

**WWF MEOW**

> Marine Ecoregions of the World: A Bioregionalization of Coastal and Shelf Areas

Super easy shapefile download [here](https://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/marine-ecoregions-of-the-world-a-bioregionalization-of-coastal-and-shelf-areas)!

<br>

**WWF TEOW**

> Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World

Super easy shapefile download [here](https://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/terrestrial-ecoregions-of-the-world)!

<br><br>

### Protected areas

**WDPA**

>  Most comprehensive global database of marine and terrestrial protected areas. It is a joint project between UN Environment Programme and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

Interactive exploration [here](https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/thematic-areas/wdpa?tab=Methodology).

And a user guide [PDF](https://wdpa.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/WDPA_Manual/English/WDPA_WDOECM_Manual_1_6.pdf)



## Country boundaries

**GADM**

> GADM provides maps and spatial data for all countries and their sub-divisions. 

[Browse](https://gadm.org/maps.html) our maps or [download](https://gadm.org/download_country.html) the data by country. 

<br><br>

**Natural Earth**

> Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10m, 1:50m, and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data.

Available features list [here](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/features/).


## Country boundaries

Also, check ou the R package `rnaturalearth`:

```{r}

#| echo: true
#| eval: true

library(rnaturalearth)
library(ggplot2)

world <- ne_countries()
africa <- ne_countries(continent = "africa")
france <- ne_countries(country = "france")
```

```{r}

#| echo: true
#| eval: true

theme_set(theme_bw())
ggplot(africa) + geom_sf()

```
## Elevation & Bathymetry

**DEM**

Digital Elevation Model.

Plenty available, but main ones are listed [here](https://gisgeography.com/free-global-dem-data-sources/).

<br><br>

**Bio-oracle**

> Essential physical, chemical, biological and topographic data layers with global extent and uniform resolution for modelling the distribution of marine biodiversity.

Download manager [here](https://bio-oracle.org/downloads-to-email.php).

Also features bathymetry.


## Satellite data

**LandSat**

> Joint program of the USGS and NASA from 1972 through the present day. Today the Landsat satellites image the entire Earth's surface at a 30-meter resolution about once every two weeks, including multispectral and thermal data. 

Check out LandSat collections [here](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/landsat).

<br>

**Modis**

> The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites have been acquiring images of the Earth daily since 1999, including daily imagery, 16-day BRDF-adjusted surface reflectance, and derived products such as vegetation indices and snow cover.

Check out Modis collections [here](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/modis)

<br><br>

/!\ *Satellite data is quite technical. Make sure you read the documentation - it's easy to get lost.*


## Socio-economics

**FAO**

> Food and Agricultural Organization has a variety of statistical data on food, agriculture and the sustainable management of natural resources.

Free and unrestricted access to 22 major databases. Check out portals list [here](https://www.fao.org/statistics/data-dissemination/agrifood-systems/en).
